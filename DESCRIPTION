Description: Provides standardized occupation-level risk measures for labor 
    market research, including automation risk (routine task intensity), 
    offshorability, skill specificity, AI exposure, computerization probability, 
    environmental transition exposure (greenness/brownness), occupational prestige, 
    and hazardous working conditions. Supports both ISCO-08 (International Standard 
    Classification of Occupations) and SOC (Standard Occupational Classification) 
    coding systems with crosswalks for bridging between classifications.
