\title{Load SOC 2018 baseline (867 detailed occupation codes)}
\usage{
base_soc(path = NULL, level = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{optional path to CSV; if NULL uses inst/extdata/source_soc_2018.csv}

\item{level}{optional character ("Major", "Minor", "Broad", "Detailed") to filter; NULL returns all}
}
\value{
tibble with columns: soc2018_code, n_digits, soc_group, soc2018_title, soc_definition
}
\description{
Returns the SOC 2018 occupations table with codes, titles, and definitions.
Use \code{level} parameter to filter by SOC hierarchy level.
}
\section{Important Note on Merging SOC Data}{

When merging data from different sources using SOC 2018 codes, occupation titles
may vary slightly between datasets (e.g., "Compliance Officers" vs
"Compliance Officers, Except Agriculture, Construction...").

\strong{Always use \code{soc2018_code} as the merge key}, not occupation titles.
The numeric codes are standardized while titles may differ across sources.

\preformatted{
# Correct: merge by code
merged <- left_join(soc, other_data, by = "soc2018_code")

# Avoid: merging by title (may fail due to variations)
# merged <- left_join(soc, other_data, by = "soc2018_title")
}
}

\examples{
# Load all levels
# soc <- base_soc()

# Load only detailed codes (6-digit)
# soc_detailed <- base_soc(level = "Detailed")
}
