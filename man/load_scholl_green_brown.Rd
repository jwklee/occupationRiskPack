\title{Load Greenness / Brownness measures (Scholl, Turban, & Gal 2023)}
\usage{
load_scholl_green_brown(path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{optional path to CSV; if NULL tries inst/extdata/source_scholl_green_brown.csv}
}
\value{
tibble with greenness/brownness measures keyed by \code{isco08_code}
}
\description{
Reads \code{source_scholl_green_brown.csv} from inst/extdata.
Provides occupation-level measures of exposure to the green transition for
119 ISCO-08 4-digit occupations. Greenness scores indicate the share of
"environmentally friendly" (task-based) job content crosswalked from 8-digit
SOC codes via Vona et al. (2018). Brownness scores indicate the share of
"polluting" (industry-based) job content crosswalked from 6-digit SOC codes.
}
\details{
The dataset also includes "ambiguous grey" occupations (Table A4 in the
source paper) which exhibit both green and brown characteristics.
