\title{Load AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) scores (Felten et al. 2021)}
\usage{
load_aioe(path = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{optional path to CSV; if NULL uses inst/extdata/source_aioe_felten.csv}
}
\value{
tibble with soc2018_code, soc2018_title, and AIOE score
}
\description{
Reads source_aioe_felten.csv from inst/extdata.
This dataset provides AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) scores measuring
the degree to which occupations are exposed to advances in artificial intelligence.
}
\section{Data Structure}{

This dataset includes:
\itemize{
\item \strong{soc2018_code}: SOC 2018 occupation code
\item \strong{soc2018_title}: SOC 2018 occupation title
\item \strong{AIOE}: AI Occupational Exposure score (higher = more exposed to AI)
}
}

\section{About AIOE}{

AIOE measures the degree to which occupations are exposed to AI advances.
The score is constructed by linking AI applications to occupational abilities
from O*NET. Higher scores indicate greater exposure to AI technologies.
This is distinct from automation risk - high AIOE occupations may be augmented
by AI rather than replaced.

\section{Note on SOC Titles}{

Occupation titles (soc2018_title) may differ slightly from official BLS titles.
When merging with other SOC 2018 data, always use \code{soc2018_code} as the
merge key, not titles. See \code{\link{base_soc}} for details.
