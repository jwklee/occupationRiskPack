\description{
Loads U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 2024-34 Employment Projections data.
Contains 832 SOC 2018 occupation codes with employment levels, projected changes,
median wages, and education/training requirements.
}
\section{Data Contents}{

\itemize{
\item Employment levels (in thousands) for 2024 and 2034
\item Employment change 2024-2034 (absolute and percent)
\item Annual average employment change
\item Median annual wage (2024). See note below about top-coded values.
\item Typical entry-level education
\item Work experience requirements
\item Typical on-the-job training
}
}

\section{Note on Median Wage}{

The \code{median_annual_wage_2024} column has two special cases:
\itemize{
\item \strong{NA values}: 6 occupations have missing wage data.
\item \strong{Top-coded at $239,200}: BLS top-codes wages at this threshold.
Occupations with wages equal to 239200 have actual median wages \emph{at or above}
this value. Real-world wages for these occupations (e.g., physicians, executives)
may be substantially higher.
}
}

\section{Important Note on Merging SOC Data}{

When merging data from different sources using SOC 2018 codes, occupation titles
may vary slightly between datasets. \strong{Always use \code{soc2018_code} as the
merge key}, not occupation titles.
