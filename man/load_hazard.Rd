\description{
Loads exposure to hazardous conditions scores from ONET Online.
Contains 894 occupations using ONET-SOC 2018 classification (8-digit codes like "47-2152.00").
}
\details{
The data includes:
\itemize{
\item \code{hazard_context}: Score (0-100) indicating frequency of exposure to hazardous conditions.
100 = Every day, 75 = Once a week or more, 50 = Once a month or more,
25 = Once a year or more, 0 = Never.
\item \code{job_zone}: Training/education level required (1-5). See Job Zone section below.
}
}
\section{Job Zone Categories}{

Job Zone indicates the level of preparation needed for an occupation:

\strong{Job Zone 1 - Little or No Preparation Needed:}
Some occupations may require a high school diploma or GED. Little or no previous
work-related experience needed. Training ranges from a few days to a few months.
Examples: agricultural equipment operators, dishwashers, landscaping workers, baristas.

\strong{Job Zone 2 - Some Preparation Needed:}
Usually requires a high school diploma. Some previous work-related experience helpful.
Training from a few months to one year with experienced employees.
Examples: tellers, customer service representatives, security guards, dental lab technicians.

\strong{Job Zone 3 - Medium Preparation Needed:}
Requires vocational school, on-the-job experience, or associate's degree.
Previous work-related experience required (e.g., electrician apprenticeship).
Training usually 1-2 years with on-the-job experience.
Examples: electricians, court reporters, medical assistants, barbers.

\strong{Job Zone 4 - Considerable Preparation Needed:}
Most require a four-year bachelor's degree. Considerable work-related experience needed.
Several years of work-related experience, on-the-job training, and/or vocational training.
Examples: real estate brokers, database administrators, graphic designers, cost estimators.

\strong{Job Zone 5 - Extensive Preparation Needed:}
Most require graduate school (master's, Ph.D., M.D., or J.D.).
Extensive experience needed; many require more than five years.
Examples: pharmacists, lawyers, astronomers, surgeons, veterinarians.

\section{ONET-SOC vs SOC 2018 Codes}{

ONET uses 8-digit codes (e.g., "47-2152.00", "47-2152.04") that are more granular
than the standard 6-digit SOC 2018 codes (e.g., "47-2152"). For example:
\itemize{
\item SOC 2018: 47-2152 (Plumbers, Pipefitters, and Steamfitters)
\item ONET: 47-2152.00 (Plumbers, Pipefitters, and Steamfitters) - hazard score 54
\item ONET: 47-2152.04 (Solar Thermal Installers and Technicians) - hazard score 52
}

Another example with multiple sub-codes:
\itemize{
\item SOC 2018: 19-1029 (Biological Scientists, All Other)
\item ONET: 19-1029.01 (Bioinformatics Scientists) - hazard score 11
\item ONET: 19-1029.02 (Molecular and Cellular Biologists) - hazard score 51
\item ONET: 19-1029.03 (Geneticists) - hazard score 50
\item ONET: 19-1029.04 (Biologists) - hazard score 22
}

To merge with standard SOC 2018 data, you can extract the first 7 characters
(6-digit code with hyphen) and aggregate:
\preformatted{
hazard <- load_hazard()
hazard$soc2018_code <- substr(hazard$onet_soc2018_code, 1, 7)
hazard_agg <- hazard |>
  dplyr::group_by(soc2018_code) |>
  dplyr::summarize(
    hazard_context = mean(hazard_context, na.rm = TRUE),
    job_zone = mean(job_zone, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_onet_codes = dplyr::n()
  )
}
}

\section{Note on SOC Titles}{

SOC occupation titles (onet_soc2018_title) may vary slightly between different source
datasets. For reliable merging across datasets, use the code column rather than
title strings.
