\title{Load Skill Specificity data (Pardos-Prado & Xena 2019)}
\usage{
load_skill_specificity(
  aggregate = c("none", "by_isco", "by_isco_wave"),
  wave = NULL,
  countries = NULL,
  path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aggregate}{Character. Aggregation level: "none" (default), "by_isco", or "by_isco_wave".}

\item{wave}{Integer vector. Filter to specific ESS wave(s) before aggregating (1-5). NULL = all waves.}

\item{countries}{Character vector. Filter to specific country codes (e.g., c("DE", "FR")). NULL = all countries.}

\item{path}{Optional path to CSV; if NULL uses inst/extdata/source_skill_specificity_cntry_year.csv}
}
\value{
tibble with skill specificity data. Columns depend on aggregation level.
}
\description{
Loads skill specificity (SS) scores based on Iversen & Soskice (2001) methodology,
as used in Pardos-Prado & Xena (2019). Contains 492 ISCO-88 codes across 32 countries
and 5 ESS waves (2002-2010).
}
\details{
Higher SS values indicate more skill specificity: high task compartmentalization within
a major occupational group relative to its workforce share. The measure is calculated as:
(share of ISCO-88 unit groups in major cluster) / (share of workforce in that major group).
}
\section{Data Structure}{

The raw data contains country-year specific SS values because labor market structure
varies across countries and time. ESS waves correspond to years:
\itemize{
\item Wave 1: 2002
\item Wave 2: 2004
\item Wave 3: 2006
\item Wave 4: 2008
\item Wave 5: 2010
}
}

\section{Aggregation Options}{

The \code{aggregate} parameter controls how to handle country-year variation:
\itemize{
\item \code{"none"} (default): Returns full data with country, wave, ISCO-88 code, and SS.
Use this when country-specific labor market structure matters for your analysis.
\item \code{"by_isco"}: Collapses to mean SS per ISCO-88 code across all countries/waves.
Use this for a single "typical" skill specificity value per occupation.
\item \code{"by_isco_wave"}: Mean SS per ISCO-88 code within each wave.
Use with \code{wave = 5} to get most recent (2010) cross-country averages.
}
}

\section{Note on ISCO-88 Codes}{

This data uses ISCO-88 classification (not ISCO-08). To merge with ISCO-08 data,
use \code{\link{crosswalk_isco_88_08}} for bridging. Note that ISCO-88 to ISCO-08
mapping involves many-to-many relationships at the 4-digit level.
